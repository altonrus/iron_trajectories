Repo contains all code to run the analyses and construct the manuscript: "Individualized risk trajectories for iron-related adverse outcomes in repeat blood donors"
The folder 1_data is not included because it contains data from the RISE study that cannot be shared publically. However, researchers can request these data at no charge from the NHLBI biolincc repository.
