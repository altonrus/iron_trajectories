abstract = {Background: Cross-validation (CV) is an effective method for estimating the prediction error of a classifier. Some recent articles have proposed methods for optimizing classifiers by choosing classifier parameter values that minimize the CV error estimate. We have evaluated the validity of using the CV error estimate of the optimized classifier as an estimate of the true error expected on independent data. Results: We used CV to optimize the classification parameters for two kinds of classifiers; Shrunken Centroids and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Random training datasets were created, with no difference in the distribution of the features between the two classes. Using these "null" datasets, we selected classifier parameter values that minimized the CV error estimate. 10-fold CV was used for Shrunken Centroids while Leave-One-Out-CV (LOOCV) was used for the SVM. Independent test data was created to estimate the true error. With "null" anb "non null" (with differential expression between the classes) data, we also tested a nested CV procedure, where an inner CV loop is used to perform the tuning of the parameters while an outer CV is used to compute an estimate of the error. The CV error estimate for the classifier with the optimal parameters was found to be a substantially biased estimate of the true error that the classifier would incur on independent data. Even though there is no real difference between the two classes for the "null" datasets, the CV error estimate for the Shrunken Centroid with the optimal parameters was less than 30{\%} on 18.5{\%} of simulated training data-sets. For SVM with optimal parameters the estimated error rate was less than 30{\%} on 38{\%} of "null" data-sets. Performance of the optimized classifiers on the independent test set was no better than chance. The nested CV procedure reduces the bias considerably and gives an estimate of the error that is very close to that obtained on the independent testing set for both Shrunken Centroids and SVM classifiers for "null" and "non-null" data distributions. Conclusion: We show that using CV to compute an error estimate for a classifier that has itself been tuned using CV gives a significantly biased estimate of the true error. Proper use of CV for estimating true error of a classifier developed using a well defined algorithm requires that all steps of the algorithm, including classifier parameter tuning, be repeated in each CV loop. A nested CV procedure provides an almost unbiased estimate of the true error. {\textcopyright} 2006 Varma and Simon; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Confidence calibration-the problem of predicting probability estimates representative of the true correctness likelihood-is important for classification models in many applications. We discover that modern neural networks, unlike those from a decade ago, are poorly calibrated. Through extensive experiments, we observe that depth, width, weight decay, and Batch Normalization are important factors influencing calibration. We evaluate the performance of various post-processing calibration methods on state-of-the-art architectures with image and document classification datascts. Our analysis and experiments not only offer insights into neural net-work learning, but also provide a simple and straightforward recipe for practical settings: on most datasets, temperature scaling-a single-parameter variant of Piatt Scaling-is surprisingly effective at calibrating predictions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Iron deficiency is observed in blood donors who meet hemoglobin requirements for donation. Frequent donation results in negative iron balance, and teenage donors may thus be at risk for adverse health consequences. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood Systems implemented ferritin testing on all successful 16- to 18-year-old (teen) donations. Low ferritin (LF) was defined as less than 20 ng/mL in females and less than 30 ng/mL in males. Donors with LF were deferred from red blood cell (RBC) donations (12 months for females, and 6 for males) and counseled to take low-dose iron for 60 days. A ferritin value less than 26 ng/mL indicated iron-deficient erythropoiesis and less than 12 ng/mL absent iron stores. RESULTS: Over 16 months, 110,417 teen donations were tested and represented 10.5{\%} of all successful donations. The rate of absent iron stores was 9.0{\%} (1.9{\%} male; 15.9{\%} female) and of iron-deficient erythropoiesis, 31.9{\%} (12.4{\%} male; 50.6{\%} female). The rate of LF deferrals was 26.9{\%} (16.7{\%} male; 36.6{\%} female). The proportion of LF donors decreased with increasing predonation hemoglobin and rose with increasing RBC donations in the prior 24 months. Seasonality in LF deferrals and the RBC contribution from teen donors was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Ferritin testing of teen donors identified individuals with LF who might benefit from risk mitigation. LF is more common in teenage female than male donors and those with RBC donations in the prior 24 months. An appreciable number of new/lapsed donors presented with LF, however. These data may be useful in guiding future risk mitigation efforts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Donor behaviors in STRIDE (Strategies to Reduce Iron Deficiency), a trial to reduce iron deficiency, were examined. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Six hundred ninety-two frequent donors were randomized to receive either 19 or 38 mg iron for 60 days or an educational letter based on their predonation ferritin. Compliance with assigned pills, response to written recommendations, change in donation frequency, and future willingness to take iron supplements were examined. RESULTS: Donors who were randomized to receive iron pills had increased red blood cell donations and decreased hemoglobin deferrals compared with controls or with pre-STRIDE donations. Donors who were randomized to receive educational letters had fewer hemoglobin deferrals compared with controls. Of those who received a letter advising of low ferritin levels with recommendations to take iron supplements or delay future donations, 57{\%} reported that they initiated iron supplementation, which was five times as many as those who received letters lacking a specific recommendation. The proportion reporting delayed donation was not statistically different (32{\%} vs. 20{\%}). Of donors who were assigned pills, 58{\%} reported taking them “frequently,” and forgetting was the primary reason for non-compliance. Approximately 80{\%} of participants indicated that they would take iron supplements if provided by the center. CONCLUSIONS: Donors who were assigned iron pills had acceptable compliance, producing increased red blood cell donations and decreased low hemoglobin deferrals compared with controls or with pre-STRIDE rates. The majority of donors assigned to an educational letter took action after receiving a low ferritin result, with more donors choosing to take iron than delay donation. Providing donors with information on iron status with personalized recommendations was an effective alternative to directly providing iron supplements.},

abstract = {Risk scores are simple classification models that let users make quick risk predictions by adding and subtracting a few small numbers. These models are widely used in medicine and criminal justice, but are difficult to learn from data because they need to be calibrated, sparse, use small integer coefficients, and obey application-specific operational constraints. In this paper, we present a new machine learning approach to learn risk scores. We formulate the risk score problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program, and present a cutting plane algorithm for non-convex settings to efficiently recover its optimal solution. We improve our algorithm with specialized techniques to generate feasible solutions, narrow the optimality gap, and reduce data-related computation. Our approach can fit risk scores in a way that scales linearly in the number of samples, provides a certificate of optimality, and obeys real-world constraints without parameter tuning or post-processing. We benchmark the performance benefits of this approach through an extensive set of numerical experiments, comparing to risk scores built using heuristic approaches. We also discuss its practical benefits through a real-world application where we build a customized risk score for ICU seizure prediction in collaboration with the Massachusetts General Hospital.},

abstract = {Background: Blood donors with low haemoglobin-concentration (Hb) and iron deficiency are well known challenges in any blood bank setting. The handling is complex, and even though iron deficiency is a frequent cause of anaemia, there are differential diagnoses. In healthy blood donors ferritin is helpful in discerning between anaemia caused by iron-deficiency and other causes, and while low Hb and low levels of ferritin, are the primary concern, some donors have too high levels, which must also be dealt with. Aims: The primary aims were to standardize and optimize the handling of blood donors with Hb below the limit for donation (7.8 and 8.4 mmol/l for female and male donors respectively). Secondary aims were to deal with all issues related to high or low either Hb or ferritin in blood donors. Methods: The problem was approached, by centralizing measurement of Hb, initiating ferritin measurements and establishing Centre for Donor Haemoglobin and Iron. An algorithm was created, taking mainly Hb and ferritin into account. The possible outcomes were: to send iron-tablets and iron-folder by mail, to give iron tablets with future donations, to refer the donor to general practitioner (GP) or, in most cases to do nothing. Pre-existing staff was trained in donor-communication and to handle the Hb and ferritin results. The donors where mainly contacted by mail, but when Hb was low or when there was insufficient effect of previously sent iron-supplementation the donor was contacted by phone to improve compliance. Hb was measured on Sysmex-XE2100D as part of a Complete Blood Count at every donation. Ferritin was measured one time in all donors, at every 10th donation and repeated when outside 60-300 mug/l at the previous donation. Ferritin measurement was also repeated if the previously measured Hb was low. The reason for not measuring ferritin at every donation was economy. Results: From February 1st 2012 to February 1st 2015, 71,450 donors (53.5{\%} women/46.5{\%} men) donated 281,814 units of whole blood (48{\%} women/52{\%} men). The mean Hb increased from 8.59 to 8.64 mmol/l in the female donors (P {\textgreater} 0.001) while the increase in the male donors was smaller 9.55-9.57 mmol/l (P = 0.017). The Red-Blood-Cell Count increased from 4.57 to 4.66 and 5.02-5.12 x 1012/l in female and male donors respectively (P {\textgreater} 0.001). The decrease in {\%} of female donors with low Hb from 4.0 to 3.5 was not significant. The {\%} of male donors with low Hb decreased from 0.92 to 0.55 (P = 0.03). Of the donors that were referred to GP on suspicion or to rule out disease, not all called back to inform about the result. Of those that did inform 12 were diagnosed with leukaemia or cancer and 2 with Vitamin B12-deficiency. Other finds were heterozygous thalassemia, hemochromatosis and polycythaemia vera. Summary/Conclusions: While the aim was to keep the donors within our frame for Hb and ferritin, the main benefit of the program was to have a well-functioning program for when the donors did fall outside anyway. The program with goal directed iron supplementation only to those that would benefit, has led to an increase in Hb and a reduction the number of donors with low Hb.},

abstract = {Summary: Blood donors and the RBCs and other components they willingly provide are essential in the delivery of healthcare in all parts of the world. Nearly 70{\%} of donated blood comes from repeat or committed donors. The amount of iron removed in the 10 min or so it takes to withdraw a unit of blood (500 ml, plus 25 ml for testing) requires over 24 weeks to replace on a “standard” diet, i.e., without added iron in the form of supplements The cumulative effect of repeat blood donations without adequate iron replacement or a longer wait between donations results in iron deficiency (ID) in many donors, low haemoglobin deferral ({\~{}}8{\%} of donation attempts), and frank anaemia in some. Moreover, ID can be associated with side effects that can impact a blood donor's health, such as fatigue, cognitive changes and other neuromuscular symptoms. In an effort to better identify and prevent ID, blood collection agencies are recommending various strategies, including changes in the donation interval, donation frequency, testing of iron status and iron supplementation. In this review, we present the evidence basis for these strategies and suggest our own approaches to improving iron balance in blood donors.},

While understandable, relying on intuition over models has ooen been found to result in inferior outcomes. Here we present a new method-select-regress-and-round-for constructing simple rules that perform well for complex decisions. .ese rules take the form of a weighted checklist, can be applied mentally , and nonetheless rival the performance of modern machine learning algorithms. Our method for creating these rules is itself simple, and can be carried out by practitioners with basic statistics knowledge. We demonstrate this technique with a detailed case study of judicial decisions to release or detain defendants while they await trial. In this application, as in many policy seeings, the eeects of proposed decision rules cannot be directly observed from historical data: if a rule recommends releasing a defendant that the judge in reality detained, we do not observe what would have happened under the proposed action. We address this key counterfactual estimation problem by drawing on tools from causal inference. We end that simple rules signiicantly outperform judges and are on par with decisions derived from random forests trained on all available features. Generalizing to 22 varied decision-making domains, we end this basic result replicates. We conclude with an analytical framework that helps explain why these simple decision rules perform as well as they do.},

SLIM can seamlessly incorporate a wide range of operational constraints related to accuracy and sparsity, and can produce acceptable models without parameter tuning because of the direct control provided over these quantities. We provide bounds on the testing and training accuracy of SLIM scoring systems, and present a new data reduction technique that can improve scalability by eliminating a portion of the training data beforehand.

abstract = {Objective: Iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia during pregnancy. Other causes of anemia include parasitic diseases, micronutrient deficiencies, and genetic hemoglobin apathies. Maternal anemia during pregnancy is the most important public health problem. Since the relationship between maternal anemia by the months of pregnancy and premature birth has been reported differently in various studies; thus, this study aims to determine the relationship between maternal anemia during pregnancy and premature birth. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis article was designed based on the recommendations of PRISMA. This study was performed from 1990 to 2018. Articles extracted using related keywords such as maternal, anemia, premature birth, and pregnancy in databases, including Cochrane, Medline, Medlib, Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Springer, Science Direct, Embase, Google Scholar, Sid, Irandoc, Iranmedex, and Magiran. Relative risk and its confidence interval were extracted from each of the studies. The random effects model was used to combine study results and heterogeneity among the studies measured using I2 index and the data were analyzed based by using STATA software version 3.2. Results: Overall 18 studies with sample sizes of 932 090 were entered into the meta-analysis. The overall relationship between maternal anemia during pregnancy and premature birth was significant (1.56 [95{\%} CI: 1.25–1.95]). Maternal anemia in the first trimester increases the risk of premature birth (relative risk, 1.65 [95{\%} CI: 1.31–2.08]). But, this relationship was not significant in the second (relative risk, 1.45 [95{\%} CI: 0.79–2.65]) and third trimester (relative risk, 1.43 [95{\%} CI: 0.82–2.51]). Conclusion: Maternal anemia during pregnancy can be considered as a risk factor for premature birth.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We assessed risk groups for iron deficiency and the feasibility and efficacy of ferritin testing in a large blood center. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Donors were informed of possible testing in the predonation pamphlet. Plasma ferritin was measured on retention samples (n = 12,595) from representative clinics. Low-ferritin donors ({\textless}25 µg/L) were sent a letter and information sheet and not called for 6 months. Ferritin testing was repeated on 25{\%} of donors; donor return rate and frequency were monitored. RESULTS: Low-ferritin donors represented 2.9{\%} of first-time and reactivated (no donation in past 12 months) male donors, 32.2{\%} of first-time and reactivated female donors, 41.6{\%} of repeat male donors, and 65.1{\%} of repeat female donors. A mean of 11.7 months after index donation, the return rate was 76{\%} for normal and 58{\%} for low-ferritin donors; returning low-ferritin donors had made approximately one fewer donation. Ferritin increased by 16.3 and 12.1 µg/L in male and female low-ferritin donors and decreased by 17 µg/L in male and female normal-ferritin donors. CONCLUSION: The minimum hemoglobin level will be increased to 130 g/L for male donors and the minimum interdonation interval changed to 84 days (four donations yearly) for female donors based on iron deficiency risk groups. Large-scale ferritin testing was feasible. Donors informed of low-ferritin results had a lower return rate, donated less often, and had an increase in ferritin on return, approximately 1 year after initial testing, compared to donors with normal ferritin results.},

abstract = {Background Blood donors that meet the hemoglobin (Hb) criteria for donation may have undetected subclinical iron deficiency. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of subclinical iron deficiency in whole blood donors with Hb levels above cutoff levels for donation by measuring zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP) levels. In addition, prevalence rates based on other iron variables were assessed for comparison. Study Design and Methods The study population comprised 5280 Dutch whole blood donors, who passed the Hb criteria for donation. During donor screening, Hb levels were measured in capillary samples (finger prick), and venous blood samples were taken for measurements of ZPP and other iron variables. These variables included ferritin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), hepcidin, red blood cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean cell Hb (MCH). Results With a ZPP cutoff level of at least 100 $\mu$mol/mol heme, subclinical iron deficiency was present in 6.9{\%} of male donors and in 9.8{\%} of female donors. Based on other iron variables, iron deficiency was also observed. Prevalence rates ranged from 4.8{\%} (based on transferrin saturation) to 27.4{\%} (based on hepcidin concentration) in men and from 5.6{\%} (based on sTfR concentration) to 24.7{\%} (based on hepcidin concentration) in women. Conclusion Results from this study showed that subclinical iron deficiency is prevalent among blood donors that meet the Hb criteria for blood donation, based on ZPP levels and on other iron variables. This finding needs attention because these donors are at increased risk of developing iron deficiency affecting Hb formation and other cellular processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Association of Blood Banks.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Understanding the effect of blood donation and iron supplementation on iron balance will inform strategies to manage donor iron status. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 215 donors were randomized to receive ferrous gluconate daily (37.5 mg iron) or no iron for 24 weeks after blood donation. Iron stores were assessed using ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor. Hemoglobin (Hb) iron was calculated from total body Hb. Total body iron (TBI) was estimated by summing iron stores and Hb iron. RESULTS At 24 weeks, TBI in donors taking iron increased by 281.0 mg (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 223.4-338.6 mg) compared to before donation, while TBI in donors not on iron decreased by 74.1 mg (95{\%} CI, -112.3 to -35.9; p {\textless} 0.0001, iron vs. no iron). TBI increased rapidly after blood donation with iron supplementation, especially in iron-depleted donors. Supplementation increased TBI compared to controls during the first 8 weeks after donation: 367.8 mg (95{\%} CI, 293.5-442.1) versus -24.1 mg (95{\%} CI, -82.5 to 34.3) for donors with a baseline ferritin level of not more than 26 ng/mL and 167.8 mg (95{\%} CI, 116.5-219.2) versus -68.1 mg (95{\%} CI, -136.7 to 0.5) for donors with a baseline ferritin level of more than 26 ng/mL. A total of 88{\%} of the benefit of iron supplementation occurred during the first 8 weeks after blood donation. CONCLUSION Donors on iron supplementation replaced donated iron while donors not on iron did not. Eight weeks of iron supplementation provided nearly all of the measured improvement in TBI. Daily iron supplementation after blood donation allows blood donors to recover the iron loss from blood donation and prevents sustained iron deficiency.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The historical approach of offering dietary advice to donors with low hemoglobin (Hb) is ineffective for preventing iron deficiency in frequent donors. Alternative approaches to maintaining donor iron status were explored. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Frequent blood donors were randomly assigned into five arms for 2 years of follow-up. Three double-blinded arms provided 60 once-daily pills after each donation (38, 19, or 0 mg of iron). Two single-blinded arms provided iron status (ferritin) or no information letters after each donation. Ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, and complete blood count were measured at each donation. RESULTS There were 692 subjects enrolled and 393 completed the study. Subjects in pill groups deenrolled more than those in letter groups (39{\%} vs. 7{\%}). Adverse events occurred equally in subjects receiving iron or placebo pills. Of those completing the study, the prevalence of ferritin of less than 12 or less than 26 ng/mL declined by more than 50{\%} and was statistically indistinguishable in the three intervention groups (19 or 38 mg of iron; iron status letter). Longitudinal analyses of all subjects showed improved iron status in iron pill groups and worsening iron status in control groups (placebo; no information letter). The iron pill groups experienced a net increase of approximately 0.6 g/dL Hb compared to control groups. The iron status letter group had little change in Hb. CONCLUSION Providing 19 or 38 mg of daily iron or iron status information were effective and mostly equivalent interventions for mitigating iron deficiency in regular donors when compared at the end of the 2-year longitudinal phase of the study. Donors without intervention had worsened iron deficiency with continued donation.},

The epidemiology of this problem in the blood donor population was therefore studied to enable appropriate targeting of potential solutions to donor ID.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A nationally representative, cluster-based cross-sectional study of Australian blood donors was performed. Donors were eligible for inclusion if they fulfilled criteria for blood donation or were deferred due to low or falling hemoglobin. Ferritin was measured and demographic and donation data were collected.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A total of 3094 blood donors were recruited, of which samples were collected from 3049 donors; 1873 had exclusively donated whole blood (WB only), 242 had exclusively made apheresis donations, and 530 had not donated ("new" donors) in the previous 24 months. The prevalence of ID in new female donors was 12.0{\%} compared with 1.3{\%} in males. The prevalence of ID in female WB-only donors was 26.4{\%}; it increased with donation frequency and decreased with age. The prevalence in male WB-only donors was 6.3{\%} with no evident change with age or donation frequency. The prevalence of ID in apheresis-only donors (females 6.3{\%}; males 2.2{\%}) did not significantly exceed that of new donors nor did it change with donation frequency. Importantly, the risk of ID could not be satisfactorily predicted in an individual donor by his or her anemia status or with predictive modeling incorporating demographic and donation data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: ID is especially prevalent in female, premenopausal, frequent WB donors. Strategies to combat ID should be implemented, specifically targeting this group.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blood donation results in a loss of iron stores, which is particularly concerning for young female blood donors. This study examines the association of blood donation and iron deficiency among adolescent and adult females in the United States. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was performed using data from the 1999–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Females who reported their blood donation history in the preceding year and had serum ferritin (SF) measurements were included. Analyses were weighted and stratified by adolescents (16–19 years; n = 2419) and adults (20–49 years; n = 7228). Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) were estimated by multivariable Poisson regression. Standard errors were estimated by Taylor series linearization. RESULTS: Geometric mean SF levels (ng/mL) were lower in blood donors compared to nondonors among adolescents (21.2 vs. 31.4; p {\textless} 0.001) and among adults (26.2 vs. 43.7; p {\textless} 0.001). The prevalence of absent iron stores (SF {\textless} 12 ng/mL) was higher in blood donors compared to nondonors among adolescents (22.6{\%} vs. 12.2{\%}; aPR = 2.03 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) = 1.45–2.85]) and among adults (18.3{\%} vs. 9.8{\%}; aPR = 2.06 [95{\%} CI = 1.48–2.88]). Additionally, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia (SF {\textless} 26 ng/mL and hemoglobin {\textless} 12.0 g/dL) was also higher in blood donors compared to nondonors among adolescents (9.5{\%} vs. 6.1{\%}; aPR = 2.10 [95{\%} CI = 1.13–3.90]) and among adults (7.9{\%} vs. 6.1{\%}; aPR = 1.74 [95{\%} CI = 1.06–2.85]). Similar results were observed in a sensitivity analysis restricted to adolescents aged 16 to 18 years. CONCLUSIONS: Blood donation is associated with iron deficiency among adolescent and adult females in the United States. These national data call for further development and implementation of blood donation practices aimed toward mitigating iron deficiency.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The consequences of temporary deferral are not well understood. This study sought to investigate blood donor return after deferral expiration. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of allogeneic whole-blood donation was conducted. All deferred donors and a random sample of eligible donors were identified from the year 2000, with subsequent blood center visits through December 2005 captured. Stratified results are reported as the percentage returning, rates of return, and time to return. Measures of statistical association and Cox regression modeling are reported. RESULTS: For first-time (FT) donors, 25 percent of temporarily deferred donors returned during the 5-year follow-up period compared to 47 percent of eligible donors (p {\textless} 0.0001); for repeat donors, 81 and 86 percent of deferred and eligible donors returned, respectively (p {\textless} 0.0001). Depending on the deferral category, 14 to 31 percent of FT and 58 to 90 percent of repeat donors returned. Rates (per year) of successful donation during the follow-up period were 0.09 for index-deferred FT donors, 0.28 for eligible FT donors, 1.0 for deferred repeat donors, and 1.45 for eligible repeat donors. Multivariate modeling indicated that in addition to deferral, age, sex, race, and education were associated with return in both FT and repeat donors. CONCLUSION: The effects of deferral were more pronounced than expected, affecting both FT and repeat donors. For FT donors, the type and duration of deferral, while important, were not as relevant as hypothesized because so few returned, suggesting the need to develop appropriate interventions to recapture those donors likely to be eligible. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Association of Blood Banks.},

abstract = {One of the most important obstacles to deploying predictive models is the fact that humans do not understand and trust them. Knowing which variables are important in a model's prediction and how they are combined can be very powerful in helping people understand and trust automatic decision making systems. Here we propose interpretable decision sets, a framework for building predictive models that are highly accurate, yet also highly interpretable. Decision sets are sets of independent if-then rules. Because each rule can be applied independently, decision sets are simple, concise, and easily interpretable. We formalize decision set learning through an objective function that simultaneously optimizes accuracy and interpretability of the rules. In particular, our approach learns short, accurate, and non-overlapping rules that cover the whole feature space and pay attention to small but important classes. Moreover, we prove that our objective is a nonmonotone submodular function, which we efficiently optimize to find a near-optimal set of rules. Experiments show that interpretable decision sets are as accurate at classification as state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. They are also three times smaller on average than rule-based models learned by other methods. Finally, results of a user study show that people are able to answer multiple-choice questions about the decision boundaries of interpretable decision sets and write descriptions of classes based on them faster and more accurately than with other rule-based models that were designed for interpretability. Overall, our framework provides a new approach to interpretable machine learning that balances accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.},

Previous studies have documented geographic disparities in obesity prevalence. Objective: To identify county-level factors associated with obesity using traditional epidemiologic and machine learning methods. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cross-sectional study using linear regression models and machine learning models to evaluate the associations between county-level obesity and county-level demographic, socioeconomic, health care, and environmental factors from summarized statistical data extracted from the 2018 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings and merged with US Census data from each of 3138 US counties. The explanatory power of the linear multivariate regression and the top performing machine learning model were compared using mean R2 measured in 30-fold cross validation. Exposures: County-level demographic factors (population; rural status; census region; and race/ethnicity, sex, and age composition), socioeconomic factors (median income, unemployment rate, and percentage of population with some college education), health care factors (rate of uninsured adults and primary care physicians), and environmental factors (access to healthy foods and access to exercise opportunities). Main Outcomes and Measures: County-level obesity prevalence in 2018, its association with each county-level factor, and the percentage of variation in county-level obesity prevalence explained by linear multivariate and gradient boosting machine regression measured with R2. Results: Among the 3138 counties studied, the mean (range) obesity prevalence was 31.5{\%} (12.8{\%}-47.8{\%}). In multivariate regressions, demographic factors explained 44.9{\%} of variation in obesity prevalence; socioeconomic factors, 33.0{\%}; environmental factors, 15.5{\%}; and health care factors, 9.1{\%}. The county-level factors with the strongest association with obesity were census region, median household income, and percentage of population with some college education. R2 values of univariate regressions of obesity prevalence were 0.238 for census region, 0.218 for median household income, and 0.160 for percentage of population with some college education. Multivariate linear regression and gradient boosting machine regression (the best-performing machine learning model) of obesity prevalence using all county-level demographic, socioeconomic, health care, and environmental factors had R2 values of 0.58 and 0.66, respectively (P {\textless} .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Obesity prevalence varies significantly between counties. County-level demographic, socioeconomic, health care, and environmental factors explain the majority of variation in county-level obesity prevalence. Using machine learning models may explain significantly more of the variation in obesity prevalence..},

abstract = {Dietary studies show a relationship between the intake of iron enhancers and inhibitors and iron stores in the general population. However, the impact of dietary factors on the iron stores of blood donors, whose iron status is affected by blood donations, is incompletely understood. In the Danish Blood Donor Study, we assessed the effect of blood donation frequency, physiologic factors, lifestyle and supplemental factors, and dietary factors on ferritin levels. We used multiple linear and logistic regression analyses stratified by sex and menopausal status. Among high-frequency donors (more than nine donations in the past 3 years), we found iron deficiency (ferritin below 15 ng/mL) in 9, 39, and 22{\%} of men, premenopausal women, and postmenopausal women, respectively. The strongest predictors of iron deficiency were sex, menopausal status, the number of blood donations in a 3-year period, and the time since last donation. Other significant factors included weight, age, intensity of menstruation, iron tablets, vitamin pills, and consumption of meat and wine. The study confirms iron deficiency as an important problem, especially among menstruating women donating frequently. The risk of iron depletion was largely explained by sex, menopausal status, and donation frequency. Other factors, including dietary and supplemental iron intake, had a much weaker effect on the risk of iron depletion. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Regular blood donors are at risk of iron deficiency, but characteristics that predispose to this condition are poorly defined. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 2425 red blood cell donors, either first-time (FT) or reactivated donors (no donations for 2 years) or frequent donors, were recruited for follow-up. At enrollment, ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), and hemoglobin were determined. Donor variables included demographics, smoking, dietary intake, use of iron supplements, and menstrual and/or pregnancy history. Models to predict two measures of iron deficiency were developed: Absent iron stores (AIS) were indicated by a ferritin level of less than 12 ng/mL and iron-deficient erythropoiesis (IDE) by a log(sTfR/ferritin) value of 2.07 or greater. RESULTS A total of 15.0{\%} of donors had AIS and 41.7{\%} IDE. In frequent donors, 16.4 and 48.7{\%} of males had AIS and IDE, respectively, with corresponding proportions of 27.1 and 66.1{\%} for females. Donation intensity was most closely associated with AIS and/or IDE (odds ratios from 5.3 to 52.2 for different donation intensity compared to FT donors). Being female, younger, and/or menstruating also increased the likelihood of having AIS and/or IDE, as did having a lower weight. Marginally significant variables for AIS and/or IDE were being a nonsmoker, previous pregnancy, and not taking iron supplements. Dietary variables were in general unrelated to AIS and/or IDE, as was race and/or ethnicity. CONCLUSION A large proportion of both female and male frequent blood donors have iron depletion. Donation intensity, sex and/or menstrual status, weight, and age are important independent predictors of AIS and/or IDE. Reducing the frequency of blood donation is likely to reduce the prevalence of iron deficiency among blood donors, as might implementing routine iron supplementation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High school students 16 to 18 years-old contribute 10{\%} of the US blood supply. Mitigating iron depletion in these donors is important because they continue to undergo physical and neurocognitive development. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Study objectives were to determine the prevalence of iron depletion in 16- to 18-year-old donors and whether their risk for iron depletion was greater than adult donors. Successful, age-eligible donors were enrolled from high school blood drives at two large US blood centers. Plasma ferritin testing was performed with ferritin less than 12 ng/mL as our primary measure of iron depletion and ferritin less than 26 ng/mL a secondary measure. Multivariable repeated-measures logistic regression models evaluated the role of age and other demographic/donation factors. RESULTS: Ferritin was measured from 4265 enrollment donations September to November 2015 and 1954 follow-up donations through May 2016. At enrollment, prevalence of ferritin less than 12 ng/mL in teenagers was 1{\%} in males and 18{\%} in females making their first blood donation, and 8{\%} in males and 33{\%} in females with prior donations. Adjusted odds for ferritin less than 12 ng/mL were 2.1 to 2.8 times greater in 16- to 18-year-olds than in 19- to 49-year-olds, and for ferritin less than 26 ng/mL were 3.3- to 4.7-fold higher in 16- to 18-year-olds. Progression to hemoglobin deferral was twice as likely in 16- to 18-year-old versus 19- to 49-year-old females. CONCLUSION: Age 16 to 18 years-old is an independent risk factor for iron deficiency in blood donors at any donation frequency. Blood centers should implement alternate eligibility criteria or additional safety measures to protect teenage donors from iron depletion.},

abstract = {The area under the ROC curve, or the equivalent Gini index, is a widely used measure of performance of supervised classification rules. It has the attractive property that it side-steps the need to specify the costs of the different kinds of misclassification. However, the simple form is only applicable to the case of two classes. We extend the definition to the case of more than two classes by averaging pairwise comparisons. This measure reduces to the standard form in the two class case. We compare its properties with the standard measure of proportion correct and an alternative definition of proportion correct based on pairwise comparison of classes for a simple artificial case and illustrate its application on eight data sets. On the data sets we examined, the measures produced similar, but not identical results, reflecting the different aspects of performance that they were measuring. Like the area under the ROC curve, the measure we propose is useful in those many situations where it is impossible to give costs for the different kinds of misclassification.},
