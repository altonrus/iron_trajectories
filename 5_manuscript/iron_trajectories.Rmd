# Introduction

> Observational studies show that frequent blood donation can cause or exacerbate iron deficiency, with higher incidence among teen donors and premenopausal women [@Cable2012; @Salvin2014; @Spencer2019; @Baart2013; @Rigas2014; @Patel2019]. Potential donors are screened using fingerstick hemoglobin or hematocrit tests and deferred if levels are below a minimum cutoff. Such hemoglobin deferrals prevent some collections from iron deficient donors but also consume time and resources from both donor and blood center, decreasing donor satisfaction and the likelihood of future donations [@Custer2007]. Because fingerstick hemoglobin is an unreliable indicator of true iron stores, many donors qualify to donate despite having low or absent underlying iron stores [@Baart2013]. More reliable measures of iron status include ferritin, zinc protoporphyrin, soluble transferrin receptor, and hepcidin, but these are more costly to measure and not available as point of care tests [@Kiss2018]. Past studies have identified several factors that increase risk of iron deficiency among blood donors. The Danish Blood Donor Study found that sex, menopause status, and donation history were the strongest predictors of iron deficiency among donors. Weight, age, vitamin use, and diet were also significant [@Rigas2014]. Similar results have been found for donors in the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands [@Cable2012; @Salvin2014; @Spencer2019; @Baart2013; @Patel2019]. Other studies have analyzed predictors for a low hemoglobin deferral for repeat blood donors, identifying age, time since last donation, and donation history as strong predictors [@Baart2011; @Baart2012]. To our knowledge, no prediction model has been developed that simultaneously considers the competing risks of hemoglobin deferral and of collecting blood from a donor whose iron stores are low or absent at the time of collection.

> In this study, we developed machine learning models to estimate how risk of hemoglobin deferral and completed donations from donors with low or absent iron stores develop as a function of time from an index donation to a subsequent donation attempt in a cohort of donors from the REDS-II Iron Status Evaluation (RISE) study. We also compared predictive performance with and without ferritin and soluble transferritin receptor (STfR), two biomarkers that were available for our study population but are not routinely collected by most US blood centers.

# Methods

> Using data from the RISE study, we trained multiclass prediction models to predict the risk of three iron-related adverse outcomes at a subsequent donation attempt based on the time until the donor returned. The adverse outcomes were hemoglobin deferral and completing a donation with either low or absent iron stores. We assessed the models' predictive performance, compared performance with and without the inclusion of two non-routine biomarkers (ferritin and sSTfR) as features for prediction, and generated and analyzed individual risk profiles for each donor's likelihood of iron-related adverse donation outcomes at their next visit as a function of how long until they return.

## Data preprocessing and formatting

> The RISE dataset contains data on all visits to a blood center for 2,425 donors over a 2-year period. Data elements include past donation history, biometrics for each visit, and questionnaire responses regarding demographics, diet, supplemental iron consumption, female reproductive health, and demographics from a baseline and final visit. We used 42 features from an index donation together with the time until the donor returns to predict the outcome of a follow-up donation attempt. We assumed that donor characteristics measured at the baseline visit such as diet, vitamin use, smoking, and female reproductive health would not change significantly over the study period, and we used them to predict outcomes following subsequent donations by the same donor. We re-coded or imputed missing values for some fields; `r run_reference("t-features")` contains these details for all features used for prediction. We also included a composite dietary iron consumption score that was generated for each donor in the RISE dataset as part of another secondary analysis [@Spencer2019a].

> To generate the model development dataset, we considered donations with at least 150 mL of red blood cell loss as potential index donations, which included whole blood donations, apheresis red blood cell donations, and some donations that were classified as 'quantity not sufficient'. We excluded potential index donations that were double red cell donations or that were missing a measurement of ferritin and either fingerstick hemoglobin or hematocrit. If follow-up visits were recorded after potential index donations, we generated labels with the time until the follow-up visit (in days) and its outcome. For all index donations followed by a visit with significant iron loss, defined as a loss of at least 55 mL of red blood cells, we generated a label for the index donation based on the first such follow-up visit. We also generated labels for each index donation based on any follow-up visits that did not result in significant iron loss (i.e., visits resulting in a deferral or apheresis donations of platelets or plasma with \<55 mL of red blood cell loss) if they occurred before any follow-up visits with significant iron loss. For each index donation $i$, the outcome of its follow-up visits ($z_i$) was classified as hemoglobin deferral ($z_i=1$) if one were recorded; as a low iron donation ($z_i=2$) if pre-donation ferritin was $\geq12$ mg/dl and $<20$ mg/dl for women or $\geq12$ mg/dl and $<30$ mg/dl for men; as an absent iron donation ($z_i=3$) if pre-donation ferritin was \<12 mg/dl; and as a 'no adverse outcome' donation otherwise ($z_i=0$). We excluded follow-up donations without ferritin measurements from the model development dataset.

## Prediction model development

### Model selection

> We evaluated several candidate model types: gradient boosted machines, random forest, regression trees, and generalized linear models with elastic net regularization (with and without all second order interaction terms). For each model type we evaluated multiple hyperparameter settings via grid search, with specific hyperparameter values described in `r run_reference("t-mod-tuning")`. We implemented a nested cross validation procedure with resampling to minimize bias in model selection and assessment [@Varma2006]. In this process, we generated 15 *model assessment partitions* which consisted of 3 resamples of 5 equal-sized partitions of the entire dataset that were generated with stratified sampling to ensure the distribution of outcomes was balanced across partitions. For each model assessment partition, we defined all data not included in the partition as the corresponding *model tuning set*. Within the 15 tuning sets, we assessed all candidate model configurations (model type and hyperparameter setting) using 5-fold validation, assessing the multiclass area under the reliever operator characteristic curve (multiclass AUC) using the Hand and Till method [@Hand2001]. We compared model configurations based on the average multiclass AUC across 5 cross validation folds averaged over all 15 tuning sets (assessing a total of 75 realizations of each candidate model configuration).

> We also considered ensemble models, which combine the risk scores from multiple base models. We assessed two methods of combining risk scores from base models: a simple average and a weighted average, for which we weighted each model's score proportionally to its accuracy raised to a power of four as suggested by Large et. al. [@Large2019] (**Q: the simple average outperformed the wieghted average. Should I just take this out and pretend we never did it?**). We assessed AUC for each candidate ensemble configuration across the same 5 cross validation folds within each of the 15 tuning sets.

> We selected the top model configuration based on the highest multiclass AUC. To produce an unbiased assessment of the selected model configuration, we then assessed multiclass AUC on each of the 15 model assessment partitions. For each assessment partition, we trained the model configuration on all data not in the partition and used this model to generate risk scores on the assessment partition. We then calculated multiclass AUC for the partition.

> To assess impact of measuring ferritin and STfR on ability to predict iron-related adverse outcomes at follow-up donation attempts, we repeated this model development process twice. In the "extra biomarkers" model, we used ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor and derived measures as variables for prediciton. Because these biomarkers are not currently measured for most blood donations in the United States, we also developed a "standard biomarkers" version that excluded ferritin and soluble transferritin receptor.

### Feature importance

> For the two selected model configurations, we also assessed the importance of features for prediction using a random permutation method [@Breiman2001]. In this method, we randomly sample one column of the dataset in each model assessment partition and generate risk scores using a model developed using the top configuration trained on all data not in that partition. We then calculated the percent decrease in multiclass AUC. We assessed feature importance on each of the 15 tuning datasets and ranked features acording to the median decrease in multiclass AUC acros each tuning set.

### Calibration

> Our model development dataset could have a skewed distribution of outcomes for two reasons: we included multiple follow-up labels for some index donations, and some candidate index donations were followed by a completed donation with no ferritin measure. To address this, we engineered another dataset for calibration in which each index donations was labeled once based on the first follow-up visit that resulted in either a hemoglobin deferral or a collection of at least 55 mL of red blood cells. We also included follow-up visit resulted in a donation for which ferritin was not measured, we labeled the outcome as $z_i=-1$.

> To calibrate the top model for the standard and extra biomarker versions, we retrained the selected model configuration on the entire model development dataset and then calibrated the predicted probabilities to the first return dataset. For this, we estimated the distribution of outcomes for follow-up visits from the first return dataset by assuming that the distribution of absent, low, and 'no-adverse outcome' donations in follow-up donations at which ferritin was not measured would be the same as for those with ferritin measured. Mathematically, we first totaled each follow-up outcome as $n^{(k)}$, where $k=-1, 0, 1, 2, 3$ correspond to the outcomes described above. We then calculated $\tilde{n}^{(k)}$, an estimation of what the totals would have been if ferritin were measured for all follow-up donations, as $\tilde{n}^{(1)} = n^{(1)}$ (hemoglobin deferral) and $\tilde{n}^{(l)} = n^{(l)}+n^{(-1)}\frac{n^{(l)}}{n^{(0)}+n^{(2)}+n^{(3)}}$ for $l=0,2,3$ (completed donations). We then used our top model to generate the unnormalized probability vector $[\hat{q}_i^{(0)}, \hat{q}_i^{(1)}, \hat{q}_i^{(2)}, \hat{q}_i^{(3)}]$ for each index donation $i$. We computed weights $w^{(k)}$ for the unnormalized probability of each outcome $\hat{q}_i^{(k)}$ by solving the system of equations $\sum_{i=1}^I w^{(k)}\hat{q}_i^{(k)}/\sum_{\tilde{k}=0}^4 w^{(\tilde{k})}\hat{q}_i^{(\tilde{k})} = \tilde{n}^{(k)}$ for $k=0,1,2,3$. The final calibrated model used parameters $a^{(k)}$, $b^{(k)}$, and $w^{(k)}$ together with the uncalibrated scores from the model $z_i^{(k)}$ to produce the estimated likelihood of each outcome at a follow-up donation as $\tilde{q}^{(k)}=w^{(k)}\hat{q}^{(k)}/\sum_{\tilde{k}=1}^4 w^{(\tilde{k})}\hat{q}_j^{(\tilde{k})}$ where $\hat{q}_i^{(k)} = \sigma (a^{(k)} z_i^{(k)} + b^{(k)})$. This ensured that the expectation of the distribution of the predicted outcome for the first return dataset would correspond to our estimated totals $\tilde{n}^{(k)}$.

# Risk trajectory analysis

> For each index donation, we generated a risk trajectory by predicting the likelihood of each outcome at the donor's next donation attempt using the calibrated model for every followup donation interval between 56 and 256 days, and we generated graphical representations of individual donors' risk trajectories. We analyzed how risk of adverse events evolved from a post-donation interval of 56 days to one of 256 days. We performed multiple subgroup analyses, where-in we segmented the donors by one of the variables. For each subgroup, we calculated the mean and 95% confidence interval for the estimated risk of each adverse event for each donation interval from 56 to 250 days, which we plotted.

> In the RISE dataset, a total of `r nrow(dt.firstreturn)` donations from `r dt.firstreturn[, uniqueN(RandID)]` donors were followed by at least one follow-up visit. We removed `r dt.firstreturn[is.na(FingerstickHGB_equiv), .N]` index donations because hemoglobin was not recorded, and we removed a further `r dt.firstreturn[time_to_fu < 56, .N]` index donations from the first return dataset because the follow-up visit was less than 56 days later. The first return dataset contained `r dt.firstreturn[!is.na(FingerstickHGB_equiv) & time_to_fu >= 56, .N]` index donations labeled with the outcome of the first follow-up donation. That outcome was a hemoglobin deferral for `r dt.firstreturn[!is.na(FingerstickHGB_equiv) & time_to_fu >= 56 & fu_outcome == 1, .N]` index donations; a low-iron donation for `r dt.firstreturn[!is.na(FingerstickHGB_equiv) & time_to_fu >= 56 & fu_outcome == 2, .N]`; an absent iron donation for `r dt.firstreturn[!is.na(FingerstickHGB_equiv) & time_to_fu >= 56 & fu_outcome == 3, .N]`; no adverse outcome for `r dt.firstreturn[!is.na(FingerstickHGB_equiv) & time_to_fu >= 56 & fu_outcome == 0, .N]`; and a completed donation with unknown iron status for `r dt.firstreturn[!is.na(FingerstickHGB_equiv) & time_to_fu >= 56 & fu_outcome == -1, .N]`. The model development dataset included `r dt.md[ , uniqueN(donation_id)]` unique index donations from `r dt.md[ , uniqueN(RandID)]` donors. `r tbl_labels_per_idx[[1]]` index donations were labeled with one follow-up donation, `r tbl_labels_per_idx[[2]]` were labeled twice, and `r dt.md[ , uniqueN(donation_id)] - tbl_labels_per_idx[[1]] - tbl_labels_per_idx[[2]]` were labeled with 3 or more follow-up visit outcomes (maximum of 8).

## Prediction model

> We evaluated over 2,000 model configurations (model type and hyperparameter settings) across the five candidate model types. `r run_reference("f-tuning-auc")` shows the average overall AUC within the 15 tuning datasets for each model configuration, and `r run_reference("t-mod-tuning")` shows the top hyperparameter setting for each model type. The overall top model was a gradient boosted decision tree. It had an AUC of 75.0% -- 75.8% across the 15 tuning set and a mean AUC of 76.1% as estimated using the outer cross-validation folds. As shown in `r run_reference("f-roc-compare")`, discriminative performance was highest for predicting no adverse outcome donations and lowest for predicting low iron donations. In a secondary analysis, we found that use of ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, and body iron increased the overall AUC from 77% to 82% among the subset of donations for which those values were recorded. Inclusion of these biomarkers increased discriminative performance most substantially for identifying absent iron donations and had little effect on ability to discriminate hemoglobin deferrals.

featimp_XB <- fread("../4_output/feature_importance_medians.csv")
```

> Variable importance for the most important variables for the standard and extra biomarker versions of the model are shown in `r run_reference("f-feat-imp-both")`, and all variables are shown in `r run_reference("f-var-imp-noXB")` and `r run_reference("f-var-imp-XB")`. For the top model with standard biomarkers, the most important variable was the time until the donor returns, followed by venous hemoglobin and the units of red blood cells donated in the past 24 months (median decrease in multiclass AUC of `r featimp_XB[model=="noXB" & feature=="time_to_fu", percent(median_AUC_pctchg, accuracy=0.1)]`, `r featimp_XB[model=="noXB" & feature=="DER_AdjVenousHgb", percent(median_AUC_pctchg, accuracy=0.1)]`, and `r featimp_XB[model=="noXB" & feature=="DER_RBC_Last24months", percent(median_AUC_pctchg, accuracy=0.1)]`, respectively). For the top model with extra biomarkers, ferritin was by far the most important variable, followed by the time unitl the donor returns and the fingerstick hemoglobin or hematocrit (median decrease in multiclass AUC of `r featimp_XB[model=="XB" & feature=="ARUP_Ferritin", percent(median_AUC_pctchg, accuracy=0.1)]`, `r featimp_XB[model=="XB" & feature=="time_to_fu", percent(median_AUC_pctchg, accuracy=0.1)]`, and `r featimp_XB[model=="XB" & feature=="FingerstickHGB_equiv", percent(median_AUC_pctchg, accuracy=0.1)]`, respectively). Interesting, shuffling some variables derived from the extra biomarkers actually improved performance, suggesting that removing these variables could improve predictive performance (Log ferritin, body iron, and log STfR/ferritin). 

> We calculated normalization weights to calibrate the model scores to the expected distribution of outcomes in the first return dataset. For both models, the calibration weights down-weighted the raw risk estimates for deferral and upweighted the risk of low and absent iron donations (`r `run_reference("t-calib-weights")`).

They were 1.4 for the probability of no adverse outcome; 0.47 for the probability of a hemoglobin deferral; 1.1 for the probability of a low iron donation; and 1.2 for the probability of an absent iron donation.

## Individual risk profiles

> Figure shows the individual risk trajectories from two donations: one for a donor whose risk of an adverse outcome was high at day 56 but declined over time and another for a donor who had a low risk of adverse outcomes even at day 56. `r run_reference("f-sixty-trajectories")` shows the same plots for 60 randomly selected index donations from the first return dataset. Notably, estimated risk did not monotonically decrease for all adverse events for all donors. For example, the risk of a low iron donation increased as risk of hemoglobin deferral or an absent iron donation fell for some donors.

> Figure shows the probability of any adverse outcome at post-donation day 56 and post-donation day 250. The median risk of any adverse outcome at day 56 was 71% (IQR 43% -- 86%), but this dropped to 23% (IQR 12% -- 41%) at post-donation day 250. While risk of an adverse outcome fell for most donors, some continued to have a high risk even at post-donation day 250. For 787 donors (11%), estimated risk of any adverse outcome was above 60% at post-donation day 250, which may indicate an underlying iron-related condition unrelated to repeat blood donation.

> `r run_reference("f-ae-trajectory-examples")` shows different trajectory types.

> `r run_reference("f-traject-by-iron-status")` is by iron status.

> `r run_reference("f-traject-by-venous-hgb")` is by tertile of venous hemoglobin.

> `r run_reference("f-traject-by-gender")` shows different gender.

> `r run_reference("f-traject-by-RBC-loss")` shows tertiles of red blood cells lost.

> `r run_reference("f-traject-iron_supplementation")` shows whether people take daily iron supplementation.

> `r run_reference("f-traject-composite_iron")` shows tertiles of the composite iron scores.

# Discussion

> Risk of iron-related adverse outcomes at follow-up donations can be estimated as a function of the return time using data available at an index donation. Estimated risk decreased precipitously for most donors if they waited longer to return, suggesting that tailoring donors' IDIs to individual donors' risk profiles may be an effective strategy for managing risk of iron-related adverse donation outcomes without unduly restricting return donations from low-risk donors. Risk for some donors remained high even 250 days later, suggesting that these methods could also be used to identify individuals who may be poor candidates for repeat blood donation due to underlying iron deficiency. Including ferritin as a predictor improved risk estimation, particularly with respect to estimating risk of absent iron donations.

> Our analysis has several limitations. The RISE study asked participants to commit to frequent blood donation and targeted recruitment to achieve proportional representation based on gender and donation history [@Cable2011]. Further study is needed to assess the generalizability of our prediction model's performance to a general blood donor population. Additionally, the outcomes we estimated at the population level are specific to the RISE cohort. In particular, the baseline rate of adverse outcomes and the reduction in supply introduced by tailored IDIs may be lower in populations with lower return rates. Another limitation of the RISE data is that ferritin and other biomarkers were not measured for all follow-up visits. We factored this into our analysis by assuming these biomarkers were missing at random, but this may not be the case.

> Two other limitations must be overcome before tailored IDIs can be implemented in practice. First, a decision-maker must identify risk thresholds for each adverse outcome in our method. Experts may not agree on the level of risk that is acceptable and how the sufficiency of the blood supply should be weighed against risks to donors. Further work is needed to understand these trade-offs and identify reasonable risk thresholds. Second, this method may face significant barriers to implementation. Sophisticated machine learning techniques for decision-making require technical expertise to develop and maintain and are opaque in the sense that humans cannot readily understand how the system arrived at a decision. In a growing literature on interpretable machine learning, methods have been developed for constructing simpler decision rules that sometimes perform on par with advanced machine learning techniques [@Jung2017; @Ustun2016; @Letham2015; @Lakkaraju2016; @Ustun2019]. Further work is needed to assess barriers to the adoption of the tailored IDI method developed here and to determine whether simpler decision rules might be easier to implement and perform similarly. Despite these limitations, our analysis suggests that individual risk prediction could be a useful tool for ensuring a sufficient blood supply while managing iron-related risks to repeat blood donors.
